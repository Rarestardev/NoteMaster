üì¶ Backup & Restore Functionality

This section allows you to securely save your notes, tasks, and subtasks in an encrypted backup file, and restore them whenever needed.

‚úÖ When backing up:
A backup file containing all your current app data will be saved to your selected location.

‚úÖ When restoring:
The data from the backup file will completely replace your current app data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning:
Do not delete or modify the backup file. It is the only way to recover your data. If the file is lost or damaged, your information cannot be restored.

We recommend storing the backup file in a safe place, such as cloud storage or a private folder.
